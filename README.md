# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-learning-Deep-Learning
ðŸ§  Overview
This project is focused on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Churn prediction helps companies identify customers who are likely to leave their service and take proactive retention actions â€” which is crucial for business growth and cost reduction.

ðŸ“‚ Key Features
âœ… Data Preprocessing: Cleaned real-world churn dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized key relationships and trends using seaborn, matplotlib, and pairplots.

âœ… Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Descision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

âœ… Deep Learning Model:

Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras.

âœ… Performance Evaluation:

Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC Score.

Used Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports for insights.

âœ… Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied PCA for 2D and 3D visualization of decision boundaries and feature clustering.

ðŸš€ Results
The ANN model demonstrated high performance and consistency across metrics, outperforming many classical ML models â€” making it a strong candidate for deployment in real-time churn prediction systems.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib, Seaborn

XGBoost

Plotly (for 3D visualization)

ðŸ“ˆ Use Case
Perfect for businesses in telecom, SaaS, or subscription-based models aiming to improve customer retention strategies through AI-powered insights.
